\*\*custom folders and date based folders are viewports into the all to do's. You should be able to delete folders and have the to do still exist in the all section but also be able to delete the to-do's from the custom folders.

\*\*need to leverage a "tag" system to allow for to do's to display in multiple folders

need to continue by setting up functionality for to dos:

- create folder views - need to create a new div that holds all to dos and then switch with other divs that hold partial todos that match folder selected

- date functionality warning if toDo is overdue (localstorage API)
- expand/collapse capability for custom folders
- styling updates for remaining buttons and text areas and forms + expand/collapse dynamic icons
- confirm folder item is being removed from object arrays when removed from navigation pane

Add on

- pomodoro timer
  \*\* would be great to be able to reorder custom folders
- maybe moving toDos marked complete to the bottom of the list????
