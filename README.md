\*\*custom folders and date based folders are viewports into the all to do's. You should be able to delete folders and have the to do still exist in the all section but also be able to delete the to-do's from the custom folders.

\*\*need to leverage a "tag" system to allow for to do's to display in multiple folders

\*\* would be great to be able to reorder custom folders

need to continue by setting up functionality for to dos:

- date functionality (date node from odin example) USE MODULE TO UPDATE FORMATTING!
- mark complete functionality (mostly CSS but maybe some added functionality [move to bottom of list???])
- update/fix expand capability for to dos
- tagging function to add to folders as needed
- expand capability for custom folders
- form validation for to do modal

Add on

- pomodoro timer
