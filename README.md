\*\*custom folders and date based folders are viewports into the all to do's. You should be able to delete folders and have the to do still exist in the all section but also be able to delete the to-do's from the custom folders.

\*\*need to leverage a "tag" system to allow for to do's to display in multiple folders

\*\* would be great to be able to reorder custom folders

need to continue by setting up functionality for to dos:

- styling the description section and adding in the collapsible capability
- date functionality (date node from odin example)
- mark complete functionality (mostly CSS but maybe some added functionality [move to bottom of list???])
- tagging function to add to folders as needed

Add on

- pomodoro timer
