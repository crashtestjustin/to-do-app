\*\*custom folders and date based folders are viewports into the all to do's. You should be able to delete folders and have the to do still exist in the all section but also be able to delete the to-do's from the custom folders.

\*\*need to leverage a "tag" system to allow for to do's to display in multiple folders

\*\* would be great to be able to reorder custom folders

need to continue by setting up functionality for to dos:

- date functionality (date node from odin example) USE MODULE TO UPDATE FORMATTING - including warning if overdue
- tagging function to add to folders as needed - need to add dynamic multi-select dropdown to the description section (make updateable as usual) -this will drive folder views
- create folder views
- expand/collapse capability for custom folders
- form validation for to do modal
- styling updates for remaining buttons and text areas and forms + update styling for app
- maybe moving toDos marked complete to the bottom of the list????

Add on

- pomodoro timer
