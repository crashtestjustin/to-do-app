\*\*custom folders and date based folders are viewports into the all to do's. You should be able to delete folders and have the to do still exist in the all section but also be able to delete the to-do's from the custom folders.

need to continue by setting up functionality for to dos:

- mobile compatability
- pomodoro timer

Future Add ons

- create folder views - ORDER THE FILTERS BY DATE THEN BY DATA ITEM?
- maybe moving toDos marked complete to the bottom of the list
- reorder custom folders via drag and drop
