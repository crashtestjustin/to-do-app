\*\*custom folders and date based folders are viewports into the all to do's. You should be able to delete folders and have the to do still exist in the all section but also be able to delete the to-do's from the custom folders.

need to continue by setting up functionality for to dos:

- check for all expanded on toDo item click to change the text content of the expand all button as needed
- expand/collapse capability for custom folders
- styling updates for remaining buttons and text areas and forms + expand/collapse icons on page elements
- removed folder array item from folder object array when removed from navigation pane
- create folder views - ORDER THE FILTERS BY DATE THEN BY DATA ITEM???

Add on

- pomodoro timer
  \*\* would be great to be able to reorder custom folders
- maybe moving toDos marked complete to the bottom of the list????
