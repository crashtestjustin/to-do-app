\*\*custom folders and date based folders are viewports into the all to do's. You should be able to delete folders and have the to do still exist in the all section but also be able to delete the to-do's from the custom folders.

\*\*need to leverage a "tag" system to allow for to do's to display in multiple folders

need to continue by setting up functionality for to dos:

- expand/collapse capability for custom folders
- change folder selected button colour (default the all to be seleected colour on page load)
- styling updates for remaining buttons and text areas and forms + expand/collapse icons on page elements
- removed folder array item from folder object array when removed from navigation pane
- create folder views - ORDER THE FILTERS BY DATE THEN BY DATA ITEM???

Add on

- pomodoro timer
  \*\* would be great to be able to reorder custom folders
- maybe moving toDos marked complete to the bottom of the list????
