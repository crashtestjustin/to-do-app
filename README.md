initial setup complete:

- create modals for adding to dos - link those to the existing test folder create & to do functions

\*\*custom folders and date based folders are viewports into the all to do's. You should be able to delete folders and have the to do still exist in the all section but also be able to delete the to-do's from the custom folders.

\*\*need to leverage a "tag" system to allow for to do's to display in multiple folders

\*\* would be great to be able to reorder custom folders

need to continue by setting up functionality for to dos:

- date functionality (date node from odin example)
- mark complete functionality (mostly CSS but maybe some added functionality [move to bottom of list???])

Add on

- pomodoro timer
