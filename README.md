This is a simple to do application made entirely using javascript and CSS and compiled with webpack. The premise here was
to gain exposure to create applications using only js and challenging myself with new toolsets to create new items such as
dynmic multi-selects across multiple locations and dynamic folders that update based on custom folder views. Also it is the first
time creating a live timer on the UI.

Future Add ons

- mobile compatability
- create folder views - ORDER THE FILTERS BY DATE THEN BY DATA ITEM?
- maybe moving toDos marked complete to the bottom of the list
- reorder custom folders via drag and drop
